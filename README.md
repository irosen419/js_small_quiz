# Just a little quiz thing 🤷🏻‍♂️

## DOM

### 1. What will happen when you run the following code?

```javascript
const buttons = document.getElementsByClassName('button')
buttons.addEventListener("click", function(e){
    console.log(e.target)
})    
```
```
First, we add event listeners to all elements with the className 'button.' Next, each button, when clicked will be logged to the console.
.... That's what they WANT to do. This will throw an error because you cannot attach an event listener to an HTML collection without looping or bubbling?
```

### Use the following HTML to answer the rest of the questions.

```html
<div id="container">
    <h4>This is a cool heading!</h4>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>The first list item</li>
        <li>The second list item</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a random "p" tag with a <span>SPAN</span> inside of it for some reason!</p>
    <li>This list item clearly makes no sense here!!! Who wrote this horrible code?</li>
</div>
```

### 2. Provide the JavaScript code that would get the second list item from the DOM and save it to a variable called `secondListItem`.

```javascript
let lis = document.querySelectorAll('ul.list > li')[1]
```

### 3. Once you have the `secondListItem` node, how could you traverse the DOM tree to get the `<p>` tag.


```javascript
let p = li.parentElement.nextElementSibling
```

### 4. What query could you do to get just the `li` tags that are inside the `ul` and not that random janky one that's near the bottom for some reason?


```javascript
let lis = document.querySelectorAll('ul.list > li')
```

## Events

### 5. Why do we use a `DOMContentLoaded` listener?

```
Because we don't want our javascript to fire until after the DOM has loaded
```

### 6. What type of element does a `submit` event happen to?

```
A form element
```

### 7. What attribute of an `input` element can we use to easily retrieve data from form inputs?

```
name attribute
```

### 8. What are the 2 required parameters we have to pass into a call to `addEventListener`?

```
DOM event and the callback function
```

## Fetch

### 9. Write the code to do a GET `fetch` request to "notarealwebsite.com" and log the response from the server to the console.

```javascript
fetch('notarealwebsite.com')
    .then(function(response){
        return response.json()
    })
    .then(function(json){
        console.log(json)
    })
```

### 10. Following RESTful conventions (see [restular.com](http://www.restular.com) if you need a bit of help with that), write the `fetch` request to update the `user` record with an id of 1 at the URL "notarealwebsite.com".

```javascript

```

### 11. What effect does the following fetch request have in the database? What does the following fetch request *return*? 

```javascript
fetch("notarealwebsite.com/dogs/25", {
    method: "DELETE"
})
```

```
It would delete dog with ID=25. It would return a PROMISE.
```

## Datasets

### 12. Write the HTML to create a `div` element with a dataset property of "awesome" set to a value of "Steven is".

```HTML

<div data-awesome="Steven is"></div>
```

### 13. In JavaScript, how would you get the `div` element from the question above from the DOM using `document.querySelector` and the dataset?

```javascript
let div = document.querySelector('div[data-awesome="Steven id"]')
```

### 14. Write the JavaScript to create a `marquee` element with a dataset property of "jaws" set to a value of "great movie".

```javascript
let marquee = document.createElement('marquee')
marquee.dataset.jaws = "great movie"
```

### 15. In JavaScript, how would you access the "jaws" dataset property? How would you change its value to "overrated maybe"?

```javascript
let marquee = document.querySelector('marquee[data-jaws="great movie"]')
marquee.dataset.jaws = "overrated maybe"
```
